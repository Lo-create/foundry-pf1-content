The .db files can be added to user data folder\Data\systems\pf1\packs or user data folder\Data\worlds\world name\packs.

Any files added to the systems folder will be deleted and replaced if the system is updated. It is generally a good idea to backup all files somewhere else.

Feats:

Version 1.0 - This is the current version.

TODO: 
- check if everything is actually there
