The .db files can be added to 
user data folder\Data\systems\pf1\packs
or 
user data folder\Data\worlds\world name\packs.

Any files added to the systems folder will be deleted and replaced if the system is updated. It is generally a good idea to backup all files somewhere else. 

Since what I am doing is far from professional, I will just put the version history in this readme file. 

Feats:

Version 1.1 This is the current version. Feats' names got cut off if they contained a quotation mark. Fixed it.

Version 1.0 - This is the first draft. It includes all 3149 feat descriptions. There might be some entries that are not actual feats, like the "Blood Hex" entry that just gives on overview over Blood Hex feats. I also have not checked if all entries get displayed in foundry. If an entry contains something that foundry doesn't know how to deal with, it will be skipped and not included in the compendium. If more than 10% are exlucded in this way, it will display an error message. So I can only say for sure that 90% are correct. 

TODO: 
- check if everything is actually there
- icons 
- makros
